sdmx-dt
==============

The purpose of the package is to parse SDMX datasets/information into
datatables (or other data structures where necessary).

What is the point? A way for me to understand the SDMX standard and use
datatable syntax more.
So far, I have just been looking at the
`SDMX-JSON v1.0 standard<https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-json/releases/tag/v1.0>`_
which is aligned with the SDMX 2.1 standard.
